            <p class="bodyText"></p><b class="eventHeader">MOUNTED SKILL AT ARMS</b>
            <p class="bodyText">The skill-at-arms course is run in an appropriate historically documented soft costume.  All competitors run at the same game before passing to the next one. All weapons will be supplied by the Tournament Producer.

            <p class="bodyText">The following skills will be scored:

            <p class="bodyText"><b class="gameTitle">Quintain Pass:</b> The rider is required to canter (or gaited equivalent) past the quintain and strike the target.  Each complete revolution of the quintain scores 1 point.  No points are awarded for incomplete turns. An additional 1 point is awarded if the lance tip breaks.  Maximum points: determined by the number of complete turns of the quintain and/or broken tip.

            <p class="bodyText"><b class="gameTitle">Tilting at Rings:</b> Three ring stands will be placed in a straight line, 21' apart from one another with a single ring (3" in diameter) suspended from each one at approximately chest height while mounted. The rider is required to canter (or gaited equivalent) past each ring stand with the lance angled across their horse's neck and to catch and carry each ring on the tip of the spear. 2 points are awarded for catching a ring and carrying it away on the lance (the rings must remain on the lance) or 1 point is awarded for knocking the ring off the stand.  Maximum points: 6

                <p class="bodyText"><b class="gameTitle">Skill with a Sword:</b>  Two 5' tall stands are placed 21' apart with a single cabbage atop each stand. The rider is required to canter (or gaited equivalent) past the targets.  The rider may use their sword to cut at or thrust through each of the cabbages.  For cutting, 2 points are awarded for a strike which cleanly cuts completely through the cabbage or 1 point for a strike that hits but does not cut through.  For thrusting, 3 points are awarded for a thrust that fully penetrates the cabbage which the rider is then able to carry away on the sword or 2 points for a thrust that only penetrates the cabbage.  All sword swings must be made away from the horse's head.  Maximum points: 6</p>

            <p class="bodyText"><b class="gameTitle">Spear Throw:</b>  The rider is required to canter (or gaited equivalent) past the target and throw (not simply stick) a spear at a circular target placed on a bale of hay. A spear sticking in the center of the ring scores 3 points; between the inner and outer rings scores 2 points; outside the outer ring but still on the hay bale scores 1 point.  No points if the spear misses the hay bale.  The spear must stick in the target.  If it falls out after the pass, no points are awarded.  A line will be placed on the ground which will determine the minimum distance the rider must stay away from the target.  If the horse passes over this line, no points will be awarded.  Maximum points: 3</p>

            <p class="bodyText"><b class="gameTitle">Ground Target:</b>  The rider is required to canter (or gaited equivalent) past a small target on the ground and attempt to spear the target with the lance. 2 points are awarded if the target is struck and carried away on the lance and 1 point for a thrust that only penetrates the target.  Maximum points: 2</p>
             
            <p class="bodyText">A Mounted Skill at Arms course will be setup during the practice days so that all the competitors may practice their skills at their leisure.
             
            <p class="bodyText"><b class="eventHeader">MELEE a' CHEVAL</b>
            <p class="bodyText">The Melee a' Cheval is a grand melee using tourney batons where everyone is competing as individuals.  A competitor is considered defeated if they call a total of 5 sufficient blows, dismount for any reason, lose or break their weapon or until the King of Arms and Lady of Honour feel they have been defeated by their opponents.  Each competitor will be ranked in reverse order as they leave the field and receive the same number of points as their rank.  i.e. the 1st off the field will receive 1 point, the 5th will receive 5 points and the 10th will receive 10 points, etc. until all competitors have retired from the field. The last competitor leaving the field will be declared the winner of this competition.

            <ul>
                <li class="listItem">Competitors are required to wear full armour.</li>
                <li class="listItem">The weapons for this event will be supplied by the Tournament Producer.</li>
                <li class="listItem">Competitors may only strike other competitors above the waist.</li>
                <li class="listItem">Shields are not allowed.</li>
                <li class="listItem">Striking horses in any way is not allowed.  At the King of Arm's discretion combatants can be removed from the melee for excessive contact with any horse and will receive no points for the melee a' Cheval.</li>
             </ul>

            <p class="bodyText"><b class="eventHeader">JOUST a' PLAISANCE</b>
            <br><b class="gameTitle">Format:</b>
            <br>Each competitor will have the opportunity to joust against at least 6 separate opponents over the course of the event.  The joust pairings will be assigned by the Lady of Honour and her staff.
             
            <p class="bodyText">In an effort to keep the challenges balanced and not overwhelm anyone (or their horse) with too many pairings, each name can only be drawn a maximum of 4 times.  Once a competitor's name is drawn 4 times, their name is removed from the pool.
             
            <p class="bodyText">Since the name of the competitor, and anyone who has been drawn 4 times, will be removed from the pool for each round of drawing, the competitors are allowed to let the Lady of Honour know (in private) if there is someone who they do not wish to compete against and that name will also be withdrawn for that round as well.
             
            <p class="bodyText">Following the drawings, a schedule listing the pairings for the joust will be posted.  Due to the nature of this format, not all jousting competitors will compete in every jousting session.
             
            <p class="bodyText"><b class="gameTitle">Practice Sessions:</b>
            <br>All jousting competitors are required to attend the 2 days of practice sessions.  These competitors will be divided up into groups and a schedule will be posted detailing which groups will be practicing in each session. All competitors who are not riding in a given time slot are encouraged to watch these sessions to get a clear understanding of each rider's skill.  These practice sessions will also be used to determine if a competitor and/or horse combination are up to the task of competing in the equestrian events.  Their skill, turnout and attitude will be evaluated by the Lady of Honour, her staff and the King of Arms.  If they determine that a competitor is not up to the standards of the tournament, they will not be allowed to compete.
             
            <p class="bodyText"><b class="gameTitle">Armour Requirements:</b>
            <br>Joust competitors must wear historically documentable replica harness from the periods of the 14th, 15th or 16th centuries and be primarily constructed of mild, tempered, spring or stainless steel.  Fantasy, theatrical ("string armour") or aluminum armour, etc. are not allowed.
             
            <p class="bodyText">Because of the great variety of armour styles available it is the competitor's responsibility to mitigate their own risk and assume all liability as to the safety of their armour.  In addition, if the Tournament Producer or King of Arms feels that a competitor is not properly armoured, trained or has a suitable mount to participate, they will not be allowed to participate.  Each competitor also has the right to decline to compete against anyone for any reason.
             
            <p class="bodyText">Appropriate armour must meet the following requirements:
            <ul>
                <li class="listItem">padded arming garments</li>
                <li class="listItem">helmet</li>
                <li class="listItem">helmet ocular may not exceed 3/8" when presented to an oncoming rider</li>
                <li class="listItem">gorget</li>
                <li class="listItem">breastplate (backplate is not required but recommended)</li>
                <li class="listItem">shoulder, arm and hand defenses</li>
                <li class="listItem">leg defenses</li>
                <li class="listItem">brayette (if needed to cover gaps)</li>
                <li class="listItem">saddle and/or lower abdomen protection</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="bodyText">These pieces are required to be strong enough to prevent injury to the wearer and to provide a high level of protection against impact from hardwood lance tips and/or aluminum lance sockets and/or solid wooden lances.
             
            <p class="bodyText"><b class="gameTitle">Equipment:</b><br>
            Competitors are required to provide a wooden ecranch&eacute; style shield (approximately 13" x 14") which is attached directly to the target area via neck and arm straps in such a way as to cover their left armpit.  Competitors are encouraged to display their arms upon their shield.
             
            <p class="bodyText">Competitors are required to provide a suitable helmet crest and a 3'x3' banner with their arms (banner poles will be provided) to display at the VIP dinner and along the field.  Competitor's banners will be displayed during the tournaments and competitors are encouraged to wear their crests during the joust.
             
            <p class="bodyText">Competitors are required to provide a suitable caparison to adorn their horse during the joust.  Strap type barding is not acceptable.
             
            <p class="bodyText">Tournament jousting lances and tips will be provided by the Tournament Producer.
             
            <p class="bodyText">The frangible lance tips are made of 1.25" x 36" hardwood (balsa). All tips are quartered to approximately 1/3rd and halved to approximately  2/3rd their length and are fitted with coronels.  All lances and tips must be used as is and may not be modified.
             
            <p class="bodyText"><b class="gameTitle">The Match:</b><br>
            The jousting tournament will be conducted using a solid tilt fence with counter list fences.  Judges are located at each end of the tilt fence to observe the lance placement of the competitor riding away from them and to signal the score of each pass to the King of Arms.
             
            <p class="bodyText">Each competitor starts their pass at a designated end of the tilt line and returns to that same end after each pass.  At the start of each pass, the competitors present themselves at their end of the tilt line. Once each competitor has received their lance from the footman and is ready to joust they should raise their lances to signal that they are prepared to begin the pass.  Once both riders have indicated that they are ready, they may begin the pass.  Each competitor is required to maintain a canter (or gaited equivalent), while maintaining proper control of their horse and lance, throughout the entire pass and stop at the end of the list to hand their lance back to the footman.  If a horse makes the pass at a walk or a trot, the points for that competitor are not counted for that pass.

            <p class="bodyText">The target area is the torso (between the neck and waist and includes the shield, shoulders, arms and hands) which is protected by the ecranch&eacute; over the left armpit. The target area is considered to be the same size, regardless of the size and/or shape of the shield.  The shield should be presented in such a way as to offer a suitable target for the oncoming competitor.  At the competitor's discretion, if the ecranch&eacute; moves out of position during the pass, they may strike the area which would normally be covered by the shield and will be awarded points as if the shield was in place.  The King of Arms will also have the option to call for a rematch and give one of the competitors the option of an "honour pass".  An honour pass is one in which the competitor who did not properly present their shield is required to ride again without a lance, thereby giving their opponent the opportunity to have a fairly presented target.
             
            <p class="bodyText">A competitor may call a "mercy pass", by pulling their lance off-target, if they believe the pass has become unsafe. Although every effort should be made to avoid striking an unprepared rider, once the pass begins there is a possibility that the opponent may not be aware of the problem and make the strike.  No points are scored and the pass is re-run.
             
            <p class="bodyText">Unless a safety situation or strong impact occurs which prevents it, competitors must keep ahold of their lances until the pass is complete and they have handed it off to the footmen, otherwise they will score no points for that pass.  Competitors should not toss their lances to the ground or to the footman unless a safety reason exists to do so.  The competitor must maintain their seat throughout the entire pass or no points will be awarded for that pass.
             
            <p class="bodyText">If a situation arises during the competition which causes a delay in the event (i.e. horse or rider safety issues, armour or equipment failure, etc.) the King of Arms and Lady of Honour may call the match to give the riders and staff an opportunity to correct it.  If the situation cannot be corrected in a timely manner, the King of Arms and Lady of Honour, with consultation with the riders and attempt to reschedule the match.  If a reasonable attempt is not able to correct the situation, the rider will forfeit their points for the joust.
             
            <p class="bodyText">The competition must run with as little time between matches as possible so please be ready when it is your time to participate.
